Rule of Three


--------------------

In comedy, writing, and web design, three is the magic number. This tiny CSS framework lets you quickly add a full-width, three-column responsive grid to any part of your site. Very much a work in progress.

### Classes

* __.one, .two, .three__: Just add these classes to the three columns in order.
* __.nest__: Add this class to a div if you want to nest another grid inside it. 
* __.clear__: If you're adding multiple rows, give this class to the first div in each row.
* __.full__: Tells the div to stretch across the whole screen.
